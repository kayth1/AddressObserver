# Bitcoin-Address-Observer
Bitcoin Address Observer is an Android app (written in Kotlin) which let you observe any Bitcoin address. 

Currently it uses Bitnodes API to gather the current status together with plenty other information like PIX (Peer Index). If you activate it in settings, the app checks the observed addresses periodically in background and informs you as soon as the transaction count of any of the addresses changes. 

Possible roadmap
- Ask you own node instead of OXT.me
- Display more data then then transaction count and satoshi amount
- Check transactions in transaction pool as well (configurable)
- Choose import mode (clean insert, insert if not exists)
- Import xpub keys

Feel free to contribute in any way.
